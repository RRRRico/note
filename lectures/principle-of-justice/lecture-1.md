## Goal of Course

### Potential Risk

Risks spring from that fact that philosophy teaches us and unsettles us by confronting us with what we already know.

#### Personal Risk

Once the familiar turns strange, it's never quite the same again. Self-knowledge is like lost innocence,

#### Political Risk

Philosophy is a distancing even debilitating
activity. Like described in *Gorgias* by Plato, Calicles told Socrates:

> Abandon argument. Learn the accomplishments of active life, take for your models not those people who spend their time on these petty quibbles, but those who have a good livelihood and reputation and many other blessings.

Philosophy distances us from conventions from established assumptions and from settled beliefs.

## Skepticism

These moral questions are impossible whereas unavoidable.
> Skepticism is a resting place for human reason where it can reflect upon its dogmatic wanderings but it is no dwelling place for permanent settlement. Simply to acquiesce in skepticism can never suffice to overcome the restless of reason.
